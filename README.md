# ðŸŒ¸ Sri Lankan Traditional Experience

## ðŸ“– Overview  

**Sri Lankan Traditional Experience** is a web application designed to bring the rich cultural heritage of Sri Lanka into the digital space.  

The platform allows users to explore a wide range of **traditional items** along with detailed descriptions and images, while also discovering **workshops** related to those items. A user can select a workshop, choose a preferred date, specify the number of participants, and pick from the available **time slots** provided by the system. During the booking process, users are given the flexibility to either make an **online payment** or opt to **pay in cash upon arrival** at the workshop.  

After participating in a workshop, users can share their experiences by leaving **reviews**, which they can later edit or delete if needed. All personal **bookings** are accessible under the user profile, where they can also be cancelled if plans change. The system further provides detailed **profiles of instructors** who conduct the workshops, and users have the option to **contact them directly** for further inquiries.  

On the administrative side, the platform includes a powerful **Admin Dashboard**. Admins receive automatic **notifications** whenever new bookings are made, and they can manage the entire system by **adding new traditional items, creating or modifying workshops, assigning instructors, and viewing or managing all bookings**. Admins can also send **email notifications** to instructors about upcoming workshops, monitor **payments**, and review **user feedback** through a centralized table.  

Security and access control are handled with **JWT-based authentication** and **role-based authorization**, ensuring separate privileges for users, instructors, and admins. Additionally, a secure **password recovery mechanism** is implemented, allowing users who have forgotten their passwords to receive a reset code via email and create a new password safely.
